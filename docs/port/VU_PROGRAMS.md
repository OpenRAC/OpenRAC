# The games' vector unit programs, by name

Which vector unit programs each game carries, how a game's own executable
names them, and which programs the games share. It matters for the native
renderer: each VU1 program is a renderer the port rewrites for the GPU, one
program at a time ([DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), [RENDERER.md](RENDERER.md)).

The convention was first written down for the US disc of the first game by
[ReRAC](https://github.com/re-rac/rerac) (`docs/formats/vu_microprograms.md`,
ISC) and measured for Going Commando by rac2-decomp
(`games/rac2/ntsc/docs/VU-MICROPROGRAMS.md`). The numbers below were read
again from our own disc images on 2026-10-08, with a section reader of a few
lines; no program bytes are here.

## Where the programs are

The boot executable carries its vector unit code in one section, `.vutext`,
at the start of the program (EE address 0x00100080). A table section,
`.DVP.ovlytab`, has one 12-byte record for each 0x800-byte chunk of a
program:

    { u32 name_offset; u32 ee_address; u32 vu_address; }

`name_offset` points into `.DVP.ovlystrtab` at a name of the form

    .DVP.overlay..<vu_address>.<program_id>.<line>.<chunk>

so the chunks of one program share a `program_id`, and a program is loaded by
copying its chunks to consecutive addresses of a unit's program memory. The
section table is present in the retail executables of all three discs below.

## The programs

| Program | Unit | Role (ReRAC, from the first game's code) | RAC1 PAL and US | Going Commando (US) |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 55907 | VU1 | terrain (tfrag), main | 8 chunks | 8, all the same as RAC1 |
| 903379 | VU1 | terrain, second strip list | 4 | 4, 3 the same |
| 56467 | VU1 | shrubs, first list | 2 | 2, both the same |
| 912339 | VU1 | shrubs, second list | 3 | 3, all the same |
| 13507 | VU1 | ties | 4 | 5, none the same |
| 224979 | VU1 | ties, second program | 7 | 8, none the same |
| 13859 | VU1 | mobys | 6 | 6, none the same |
| 57843 | VU1 | textured sprites | 3 | 3, 2 the same |
| 221571 | VU1 | particles | 1 | 1, not the same |
| 104691 | VU0 | helper for mobys | 2 | 2, 1 the same |
| 436083 | VU0 | end of frame, transitions | 1 | 1, not the same |
| 28259 | VU0 | patch loaded once (sine and others) | 2 | 2, both the same |
| 56883 | VU1 | unknown | not there | 5 |

The PAL and US discs of the first game have the same 12 programs, chunk for
chunk. Going Commando has all 12 and one more; 21 of its 49 comparable chunks
are the first game's unchanged. rac2-decomp found its vector unit code
identical from the earliest prototype disc to the shipped game.

The roles are ReRAC's reading of the first game's code. They are a lead: each
is to be confirmed here by which draw path a program is running under before
host code is written for it.

## What follows for the native renderer

1. **How much each program draws.** The executable's table names every
   program, so a game's frames can be broken down by program. One such
   measurement exists: it was taken on 2026-10-09 by the `runtime/`
   experiment (removed the same day; see [README.md](README.md)), which ran
   the first game (PAL) from boot to 40 seconds into its first level and
   counted the instructions each unit ran, by program. It is kept here for
   its numbers, not its method:

   | Unit | Program | Role (ReRAC) | Runs started | Share of the unit's instructions |
   |---|---:|---|---:|---:|
   | VU1 | 13507 | ties | 1,697,041 | 43.3% |
   | VU1 | 13859 | mobys | 224,940 | 25.2% |
   | VU1 | 56467 | shrubs, first list | 392,174 | 21.6% |
   | VU1 | 55907 | terrain, main | 58,783 | 5.5% |
   | VU1 | 224979 | ties, second program | 45,705 | 1.7% |
   | VU1 | 903379 | terrain, second strip list | 9,251 | 0.9% |
   | VU1 | 912339 | shrubs, second list | 13,905 | 0.9% |
   | VU1 | 221571 | particles | 6,119 | 0.2% |
   | VU1 | 57843 | textured sprites | 14,590 | 0.2% |
   | VU0 | 104691 | helper for mobys | 899,944 | 99.7% |
   | VU0 | 436083 | end of frame, transitions | 39,832 | 0.2% |

   The share of instructions says how much each program works on the
   console, not how hard it is to rewrite: a native renderer replaces a
   program by what it draws.
2. **Which native renderers first.** Terrain and shrubs are the same
   programs in both games, so one native renderer for each serves both; ties
   and mobys were edited between the games and need a look at what changed.
   Ties, mobys and the first shrub program are nine tenths of VU1's work in
   the level measured above, terrain a twentieth.
3. **The `<line>` field** is the line of the program's source it started at:
   the same in both games for unchanged programs, shifted for the edited
   ones. It tells which programs to compare first when a later game is
   added.
4. Level programs may carry vector unit code of their own in their data; this
   has not been checked for any game.
