# Third-party notices: the launcher

What the launcher takes from others, and under which license. Libraries it
depends on (Tauri, Svelte, serde and the rest) keep their own licenses in
`node_modules/` and Cargo's registry; they are listed in `package-lock.json`
and `Cargo.lock`.

## The OpenRAC website

The colours, type, header bar, game cards and progress bar follow
[OpenRAC/openrac-site](https://github.com/OpenRAC/openrac-site) (`src/app/globals.css`,
`src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/Progress.tsx`, `src/lib/projects.ts`).
`public/wrench.webp` is the site's `public/wrench.webp`; `public/icon.png` is its
`src/app/icon.png`; the app icons in `src-tauri/icons/` are made from its
`src/app/apple-icon.png` with `tauri icon`.

## The T3SDK launcher

The launcher's design (a Rust side that owns every file and process, a UI
that names jobs from a fixed list, a browser preview backed by a mock, one
job at a time with live output) follows the launcher of
[T3SDK](https://github.com/Veradictus/Thief3-Decomp) for Thief: Deadly Shadows.
Two small helpers are adapted from it: the bounded process probe
(`run` in `core/src/detect.rs`, from its `src-tauri/src/proc.rs`) and the
removal of terminal escape sequences from tool output (`plain` in
`core/src/jobs.rs`, from `strip_escapes` in its `src-tauri/src/tasks.rs`).
