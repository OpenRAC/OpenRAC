//! The OpenRAC launcher's logic, without a window.
//!
//! Everything here reads the OpenRAC checkout the user points the launcher
//! at, or runs its tools; nothing is hard-coded about a game that its
//! `games/<game>/game.json` already says. The desktop app (`src-tauri/`)
//! exposes these functions as Tauri commands; this crate builds and tests on
//! any machine, without WebKit or a display.
//!
//! - [`catalog`]: the games and versions, from `games/*/game.json` and
//!   `progress/summary.json`.
//! - [`actions`]: what the launcher can run for each version, from
//!   `launcher/actions.json`, and how an action becomes a command line.
//! - [`status`]: what is in place for a version (disc, inputs, build output).
//! - [`config`]: the launcher's own settings file.
//! - [`detect`]: finding the checkout, Python, Godot and Docker.
//! - [`disc`]: reading which game a disc image is, and adding the user's image.
//! - [`jobs`]: running an action as a child process and streaming its output.
//! - [`library`]: all of the above, put together for the UI.
