# Connecting the games to the launcher

The launcher is scaffolding: the app, its look, the game catalogue, the job
runner, setting a game up from the player's disc and the first actions work,
and every game has its actions written down. This document is for whoever
wires the rest up: what "connected" means, the format of
`launcher/actions.json`, how a game is set up from a disc, and the work left,
in packages that can be taken one at a time.

Playing is the **native port** ([docs/port](../../docs/port/README.md)): the
launcher never runs the retail program or a model of the console.

Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) first for how the parts fit.

## Action states

Every action in `actions.json` has a `state`. Change it only when its
definition is met:

| State        | Meaning                                                                            | The launcher                                                  | Done when                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `planned`    | Wanted; no command yet                                                             | shows it greyed out, with its `todo` under "For contributors" | it has a `program` and `args`                                                                                           |
| `unverified` | The command is written from the game's docs but has not been run from the launcher | runs it, marked "Unverified"                                  | someone ran it from `npm run tauri dev` on each listed platform, with real inputs, and it did what its description says |
| `connected`  | Run from the launcher and known to work on its `platforms`                         | runs it, marked "Ready"                                       | (keep it working)                                                                                                       |

When you connect an action: set `state`, narrow `platforms` to what you ran it
on, delete its `todo` (or leave one for the platforms still unchecked), and
say in the commit body what you ran, where, and what it printed at the end.

## actions.json

```jsonc
{
  "format": 1, // this launcher reads 1
  "repository": [/* actions for the checkout as a whole */],
  "versions": {
    "rac1/pal": [/* actions for one version; the key is games/<game>/<version> */],
  },
}

Placeholders (anything else is rejected by the tests):

| `{dir}`               | the version's folder, absolute (`…/games/rac1/pal`)      |
| `{python}`, `{godot}` | the paths in Settings (refused while unset)              |
| `{docker}`            | the path in Settings, or `docker` from PATH              |

| `{data}`              | the game's set-up folder, `<install>/active/<game>/data` |

`cargo test -p openrac-launcher-core` checks the file against the checkout:
known versions, unique ids, known placeholders (and no version placeholders in
repository actions), a program for every runnable action, a `todo` for every
planned one, and that every `docs` path exists. Run it after every change.

To list what is left:

```sh
python3 -c "import json; f = json.load(open('launcher/actions.json'))
for k, l in [('repository', f['repository'])] + list(f['versions'].items()):
    for a in l:
        if a.get('state', 'planned') != 'connected': print(f\"{k:10} {a['id']:18} {a.get('state', 'planned'):10} {a.get('todo', '')}\")"
```

## Work packages

Each package can be done on its own. Take one, say so where the group
coordinates, and keep each commit to one action or one package
(`feat(launcher): connect rac1/ntsc's build`).

### 1. Disc verification

This is about the developer's discs in `baserom/`, which the decompilations'
builds read; a player's disc is checked by the extractor when the game is set
up (next section). `core/src/status.rs` finds a disc by name or size and says
"found"; it never hashes a 4 GB image. The checksums are `tools/openrac.py discs`'s job, which the
launcher runs as a job and whose output the user reads.

To show "verified" on the cards: give `openrac.py discs` a machine-readable
mode (for example `--json`, printing `{serial: {"path", "ok", "checked":
"sha1"|"full", "differ": [...]}}`), run it from `status.rs` or as a job whose
result the launcher stores, and cache each result by path, size and
modification time so it is not recomputed. `openrac.py` is a top-level tool
with tests in `tools/test_openrac.py`: the flag and its test go there, in a
`feat(tools)` commit of its own.

### 2. Setting a game up

The player's side follows OpenGOAL's launcher exactly; its own steps and
OpenRAC's are:

| Step             | OpenGOAL                                                                        | OpenRAC                                                                                                                             |

- The install folder is a setting (by default the launcher's per-user data
  folder); each game lives in `active/<game>/data/`, as in OpenGOAL.
- A failure ends the job with the extractor's message, `error NNNN: ...`,
  using OpenGOAL's number for the same failure (`tools/extractor.py`,
  `ERRORS`); the job's output is in Tasks.
- Ratchet & Clank names only a few files in the disc's ISO 9660 file system
  (RAC1: `SYSTEM.CNF`, the boot executable and `IOPRP243.IMG`) and reads the
  rest by sector. So, unlike OpenGOAL's, the extract step also keeps the
  image itself in `iso_data/<game>/disc.iso` (a hard link, a copy across
  file systems) for the decompile step to read.
- A disc set up this way counts as the version's disc for the level editor
  (`{disc}` in its actions), so a player needs no `baserom/`.
- Code: `core/src/install.rs` (the layout, the state on disk, the job's plan,
  uninstall), the Tauri commands `install_game` and `uninstall_game`, and
  `installGame` in `src/lib/app.svelte.ts`.

To do here: run the extractor from the desktop app with a real disc of each
game and record the result; add each disc's file count and contents hash to
its game.json (the extractor prints them for an unknown build); then the
decompile step, which is the port's asset pipeline.

### 3. Playing

Every version has a planned `play` action: the native port, built from the
decompiled C, drawn by OpenRAC's own renderer, from the assets the set-up
prepared. Nothing runs yet; [docs/port/ROADMAP.md](../../docs/port/ROADMAP.md)
says what it needs and in which order. When a version's port can be
started, its `play` becomes runnable with the port's executable and the
version's install folder, as OpenGOAL's launcher starts `gk`.

### 4. Each game's set-up, build and checks

The per-version actions carry their own `todo`s; in short:

- **rac1/pal**: `setup-asm` and `build` run `tools/setup_asm.sh` and
  `tools/build_sn.sh` directly (since 2026-10-09; they ran in the project's
  Docker image before). Check this against the project's own
  [CONTAINERS.md](../../games/rac1/pal/docs/CONTAINERS.md), which says every
  build runs in the container on Linux and macOS, before marking them
  connected. Confirm the artifact and how a mismatch shows (exit code). Mind [BUILD_FIDELITY.md](../../games/rac1/pal/docs/BUILD_FIDELITY.md):
  the launcher runs the build; it never changes how it builds.
- **rac1/ntsc**: `setup.sh` downloads and builds its toolchains (long; Linux,
  WSL, or Docker on macOS); `make elf`, `verify-baseline.sh`, `make iso`.
  Find `make elf`'s output for an artifact.
- **rac2**: needs settings the launcher lacks (package 4); the run id that
  `setup.py` creates feeds `build.py`.
- **rac3**: needs Wrench, wibo and a venv (package 4); then
  `tools/setup_asm.py`, `tools/build.py`, `tools/pr_check.py`.
- **rac4**: `setup_asm.sh`, the build (`tools/build.sh`, run directly since
  2026-10-09, as rac1/pal's), `audit_matches.py` with the project's venv.

Each game's own docs are the authority on its commands; the action's `docs`
field points at them. If a game's tool needs a change to be driven (a flag, a
machine-readable result), make it in that game's directory under its rules,
in a commit of its own, and verify the game as its docs say.

### 5. More settings

Some games need tools and folders the launcher does not know yet: rac2's
working folder for its builds (its "runtime" folder) (outside the tree; `build/rac2-runtime` works) and Wrench's
`wrenchbuild`; rac3's wibo and Wrench; per-game virtual environments. A design
that keeps `actions.json` the single place: a `tools` map in `Config`
(`{"wrench": "/path/to/wrenchbuild", "wibo": ...}`) with placeholders
`{tool:wrench}`, declared in a top-level `"tools"` list in `actions.json` (name,
label, hint, how to detect), so Settings lists them without UI changes. Add
the placeholder form to `PLACEHOLDERS` handling and its tests.

A "Download helpers" action (Wrench, wibo) must pin versions and checksums,
like rac1/ntsc's `setup.sh` does.

### 6. Windows

rac1/pal and rac4's scripts are bash; rac1/ntsc and rac2 use WSL for their
compilers. Decide per game between Git Bash (`bash` from Git for Windows) and
WSL (`wsl.exe --cd <path> -- <command>`, which needs paths converted to
`/mnt/c/...`: a `{wsl:dir}`-style placeholder). Test the job cancel on
Windows (`taskkill /T`) against a WSL process.

### 7. Updates

- **The launcher**: Tauri's updater plugin, as the T3SDK launcher does
  (signed `latest.json` on GitHub releases), plus a release workflow that
  builds the installers. Needs a signing key held by the maintainers.
- **The checkout**: the planned `update` repository action: `git pull` when the
  tree is clean, refusing otherwise. Players who do not use git need a
  different answer (open decision below).

### 8. The level editor

rac1/pal has the whole path written down, in the order a user takes it:

| Action           | State      | What it does                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `editor-extract` | unverified | the disc's 19 levels into a Godot project in `assets/godot`                                   |
| `editor-import`  | unverified | Godot reads the meshes and textures once, headless, so the first open is quick                |
| `editor-open`    | unverified | the Godot editor on that project                                                              |
| `editor-pack`    | planned    | edited scenes back into level data, under `build/`; the packer does not exist yet             |
| `editor-preview` | connected  | Godot's player on the first extracted level (Godot showing the editor's scenes, not the game) |
| `editor-tests`   | unverified | the unit tests of `editor/`                                                                   |

The unverified ones ran from a shell on macOS with a real disc and Godot
4.7.2 (extract into a new folder, the refusal of an existing one, the
headless import, the tests); none has been run from the desktop app yet. The
extractor needs Python 3.10 or newer, which is why Settings refuses an older
one. It never overwrites `assets/godot`, so once that exists the page should
offer Open, not Extract (an `artifact` on extract and a "skip when present"
rule, or a status field). The other versions carry a planned `editor-extract`
that says what the editor lacks for them
([editor/README.md](../../editor/README.md)).

### 9. Release and CI

CI runs the launcher's checks (the `launcher` job in
`.github/workflows/checks.yml`). Building installers in CI, and where they are
published, waits on package 7.

## Open decisions

These are not the launcher's to settle alone ([AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md), rule 11):

- **How players get OpenRAC.** Today the launcher needs a git checkout. A
  player-facing release could bundle `tools/` and the game folders instead,
  which changes what "update" means and where builds write.
- **Network.** Since 2026-10-09 the launcher fetches
  `https://openrac.dev/progress.json` at start-up and rewrites the
  checkout's `progress/summary.json` with it, and shows Discord Rich Presence
  unless switched off. `progress/summary.json` is a generated file that
  `tools/openrac.py progress` writes (AGENTS.md, rule 9): whether the
  launcher should keep its copy elsewhere is for the maintainers.
- **Which games and versions to put first.** The launcher shows every version
  in `games/`; the four games are rac1 (PAL and NTSC-U), rac2, rac3 and rac4.

## Keeping things in step

| When this changes                       | Change this too                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A game.json gains a version             | an entry in `actions.json` (the tests insist) and, for a new game, a theme in `src/lib/themes.ts` (the tests insist) |
| A game's build commands or output paths | its actions' `args`, `artifact` and `docs`                                                                           |
| A Rust command or type                  | `src/lib/api.ts` and `src/lib/mock.ts`                                                                               |
| The website's colours or cards          | `src/app.css`, `src/lib/themes.ts` ([STYLE.md](STYLE.md))                                                            |
