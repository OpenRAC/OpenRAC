#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Carries a matched function into another version that holds the same machine
code: takes the C from the project that matched it, with the declarations it
needs, and renames every symbol to the target's. The result is a candidate for
the target project's own check, never a match by itself.

  python3 tools/port.py FROM TO [NAME ...] [--out DIR]     e.g. rac1/ntsc rac1/pal
  python3 tools/port.py FROM TO [NAME ...] --check [--target-dir DIR] [--jobs N]

It reads the `same` rows of shared/xmap/ports/FROM--TO.tsv (tools/xmap.py):
functions FROM has matched whose code TO also has, at another address, and has
not matched. NAME limits it to some of them, by the name either project uses.
It writes, under build/port/FROM--TO/ unless --out says otherwise:

  <target name>.c   the candidate
  MANIFEST          `<target name> <candidate>` lines, the form rac1/pal's tools/integrate.py reads
  ports.tsv         every row with what happened to it

How a symbol is translated. The two functions are the same instructions, so
the n-th address one forms is the n-th the other forms (mips.references). A
symbol the source C uses has an address in the source version; the references
that reach it give the address in the target, and the target names it its own
way. Nothing is looked up in a table of data symbols, so it works for any
global the function touches.

How a global is declared follows the code as well: one the function reaches
only through $gp is small data in the target, one it reaches with lui and %lo
is not, whatever the source project wrote to get there (its compiler differs).
A global the source declares MACRO_ADDR keeps that: the assembler then picks
the form of each access, which the target's check has to reproduce.

--check then runs the target project's own check on every candidate (in
--target-dir, or the version's directory under games/), reads the compiler's
complaints about names its file already uses, writes hints, and tries again,
up to four rounds. results.tsv has each function's verdict and MANIFEST.exact
the ones that passed; landing them is the target project's own step.

`<target name>.hints.json` next to a candidate, {"alias": [...], "rename":
[...]}, changes how it is written: a symbol in `alias` is declared under a
private name with an assembler label (for a file that already declares it
with another type), and a type in `rename` gets a suffix (for a file that
already has one of that name). --check writes them.

Each version's side is the "port" entry of its games/<game>/game.json:

  as a source   sources, include, defines (what to read and how to preprocess
                it), gp, catalogue and symbols (where its names are),
                shared_headers (headers the target has its own copy of),
                refuse_headers (headers whose contents do not travel), types
                and phrases (spellings to translate), credit
  as a target   gp, catalogue, report, level_data_from and names (how it names
                an address), alias and small_data (how it declares: rac1/pal
                by plain names and a short read through a cast, rac1/ntsc
                under private names with an sda attribute), headers,
                never and never_sources (what it does not take), check

A check is either a command over a manifest (rac1/pal's tools/integrate.py),
or `"kind": "guard"`: the candidate is put under `#else` of a NON_MATCHING
guard in the target's own file, as rac1/ntsc keeps pending C, checked there
and taken out again; what passes is also written as exact.patch against the
target's tree. "alternatives" lists other readings of a rule to try on a
candidate that misses.
