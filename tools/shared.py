"""
Files the games share. While each project also lives in its own repository,
a shared file stays in every game that builds with it; shared/files.json
names the copies, and this tool keeps them the same file.

  python3 tools/shared.py check        every group's copies are identical (CI runs this)
  python3 tools/shared.py find         files identical in two or more games that the manifest does not list
  python3 tools/shared.py sync PATH    make the other copies of PATH's group equal to PATH

A group is {"what": ..., "copies": [paths]}: the same file at several paths.
"related" entries name files that began as copies and now differ on purpose,
with the reason; `check` only confirms they still exist. When a sync from a
project's own repository changes one copy, `check` fails: decide whether the
change belongs to every game (`sync` it) or the files have parted ways (move
the group to "related" and say why).
