# Level editor

The editor turns the levels on your own disc of Ratchet & Clank (PAL, `SCES_509.16`
v2.00) into a Godot 4 project. Godot is the map editor: open a level, move,
add or delete objects, and save. Tools to pack edited scenes back into game
data come later; the scenes already keep what they will need.

It sits at the top of OpenRAC because it is meant to serve all four games.
Today it reads Ratchet & Clank PAL only; the formats of the later games are
close relatives (see [docs/engine](../docs/engine/README.md)).

Never commit or share what it produces (see [docs/policy/SOURCING.md](../docs/policy/SOURCING.md)).
It only writes to new directories under OpenRAC's ignored `assets/` or `build/`.

## Before you start

You need:

- Python 3.10 or newer (standard library only).
- Godot 4, tested with 4.7.2. On macOS its command is
  `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`; below it is `godot`.
- An ISO image of your own PAL disc, placed at `baserom/SCES_509.16.iso` at the top of
  OpenRAC ([baserom/README.md](../baserom/README.md)). `baserom/` is ignored by git.

The RAC1 PAL build only needs the executable from that image
([games/rac1/pal/README.md](../games/rac1/pal/README.md)).
The extractor reads the whole image, and it stops unless the executable
inside matches PAL v2.00.

## Extract

```sh
python3 editor/extract.py godot baserom/SCES_509.16.iso assets/godot
godot --path assets/godot -e res://levels/level_00/level_00.tscn
```

The second command opens level 0 in the editor. Other levels are in the
FileSystem dock under `levels/`; double-click a `level_NN.tscn` to open it.

All 19 levels take about 20 seconds and 630 MB, one level per CPU core at
a time. Godot's first import takes about two minutes. Options:

- `--level N` (repeatable) exports only some levels.
- `--jobs N` limits how many levels are exported at once.
- `--terrain-lod 2` uses the coarsest terrain.

## Regenerate

Nothing the extractor writes is kept in git, so a fresh checkout has none
of it: run the command above to make it. The same disc always gives
byte-identical files. To rebuild a project, delete its directory and run
the command again; the extractor never overwrites an existing directory.
Godot rebuilds its import cache (`.godot/`) the next time it opens the
project.

Until the packer exists, edits made in Godot live only in that project,
and regenerating replaces them. To keep an edited level:

1. Copy its scene, `levels/level_NN/level_NN.tscn`, somewhere safe.
2. Regenerate.
3. Copy the scene back. The meshes and textures it refers to come out
   identical, so its paths still resolve.

That only works when the extractor hasn't changed since the scene was
made. A newer extractor can write scenes with other nodes (the sky's
WorldEnvironment, for instance), so after updating it, move your changes
into the new scene instead. Godot saves a scene as text, so a diff
against a fresh export shows each edit.

## Other commands

```sh
python3 editor/extract.py survey baserom/SCES_509.16.iso      # disc layout, as JSON
python3 editor/extract.py raw baserom/SCES_509.16.iso build/level-00 --level 0
python3 editor/extract.py port baserom/SCES_509.16.iso build/port-levels --level 0
```

`port` writes each level for the native port's level viewer
([port/viewer](../port/viewer/README.md)): the same meshes and textures as
the Godot export, the sky as a mesh, and the placements as JSON.

`raw` writes one level's sections as stored on the disc and decompressed,
with a manifest of their sizes and hashes.

## The project

```
project.godot
rc1/level.gd                 fly camera when a level is run
rc1/check.gd                 headless check against level.json
levels/level_NN/
  level_NN.tscn              the level
  level.json                 what was extracted: counts, bounds, code overlay
  terrain.glb                one node per terrain fragment
  collision.glb              the collision mesh, coloured by surface type
  ties/tie_<class>.glb       one mesh per tie class
  shrubs/shrub_<class>.glb   one mesh per shrub class
  mobys/moby_<class>.tscn    a moby class: its mesh (or a box) and a label
  mobys/moby_<class>.glb     a moby class's mesh, skeleton and animations
  sky.png                    the sky as a panorama, used by the WorldEnvironment
  textures/*.png             shared by the level's meshes
```

Each level scene looks like this:

```
Level_NN
  WorldEnvironment      the sky (sky.png) and flat ambient light
  Sun                   a directional light, so shapes read in the editor
  Game                  turns the game's Z-up axes into Godot's Y-up
    Terrain             fragments Terrain_000... (editable children)
    Collision           the collision layer, hidden until you show it
    Ties/Tie_NNNN       one node per placed tie
    Shrubs/Shrub_NNNN   one node per placed shrub
    Mobys/Moby_NNNN     one node per placed moby (crates, enemies, NPCs...)
```

To edit a level:

- Move, rotate or scale objects as usual. Transforms under `Game` are in
  game units and axes.
- To add an object, drag a class `.glb` from the FileSystem dock onto
  `Game/Ties` or `Game/Shrubs`. The file is the object's class.
- Per-object game fields are in the Inspector's Metadata section:
  - `rc1_index`: the object's record in the original level (new objects
    have none);
  - `rc1_draw_distance`, `rc1_directional_lights`;
  - ties only: `rc1_occlusion_index`, `rc1_uid`;
  - shrubs only: `rc1_colour`, raw integers;
  - `rc1_matrix_w`: only on objects that store 0.0 instead of the usual 0.01.
- Mobys show as their class's mesh in its bind pose, with a label giving
  the class number and name (`11 vendor`) that fades out beyond 60 units.
  Classes without a mesh (spawn points, triggers, particle spawners...)
  show as a coloured box. Each class scene, `mobys/moby_<class>.tscn`,
  has one for every class the level loads, placed or not; drag one onto
  `Game/Mobys` to add a moby. Its `Model` node carries the class scale.
  A moby's rotation in the Inspector is the game's own Euler angles
  (rotation order XYZ).
- Animated classes have a `Skeleton3D` in the bind pose and an
  `AnimationPlayer` with one animation per sequence: `seq_NN` by slot, and
  Ratchet's `ratchet_seq_NNN`. Sequences that loop in the game loop here.
  To preview one, double-click `mobys/moby_<class>.glb` in the FileSystem
  dock: Godot's import settings window plays each animation. In a scene,
  enable Editable Children on the `Model` node to reach the
  `AnimationPlayer`.
- A moby's metadata:
  - always `rc1_index`, `rc1_spawn_id`, `rc1_group`, `rc1_pvar_index` and
    `rc1_colour` (the ambient colour, 128 = 1.0);
  - the other fields only when they differ from what most mobys store:
    `rc1_spawn_flags` (0), `rc1_draw_distance` and `rc1_update_distance`
    (64), `rc1_mode_bits` (32), `rc1_occlusion` (1), `rc1_light` (0),
    `rc1_unknown_74` (-1), and a few unknown fields
    ([ASSETS.md](../games/rac1/pal/docs/ASSETS.md#mobys)).
- Textures are ordinary PNGs. Editing one changes every mesh that uses it.

Run a level (F6) to fly around it:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Right mouse | Look |
| WASD | Move |
| Q / E | Down / up |
| Shift | Faster |
| Mouse wheel | Change speed |
| F | Frame the terrain |
| C | Show or hide the collision layer |

## Collision layer

`Game/Collision` is the level's baked collision mesh: the triangles the game
tests Ratchet, bolts and shots against, with ties and shrubs already
included. It is hidden by default (`visible` is off) so it does not hide the
terrain. In the editor, click its eye icon in the Scene dock; in a running
level press C. It is one translucent, unshaded mesh with a colour per
surface, so it reads over the terrain. Triangles are double-sided here, but
the game treats them as one-sided.

The colour is the surface id, the low five bits of each face's type byte
(the other bits choose footstep sounds and exclude the face from some
queries). The game has no table of surface types, so the names are
inferences from how its code tests them, and most ids are only colours:

| Id | Colour | What is known |
|---|---|---|
| 31 (0x1f) | grey `#8c8c8c` | no special surface; most of every level |
| 0 | blue `#3373ff` | water surface (the ground probe looks for the floor below it) |
| 8, 9, 10, 12 | orange `#f27130`, `#30f2aa`, `#e230f2`, blue `#3091f2` | common; the game's wall and ledge checks test for these ids |
| 11 (0x0b) | `#caf230` | the ground snap is skipped (some special floor) |
| 13 (0x0d) | `#f23058` | liquid-like (level 12 only) |
| 1-7, 14 | other hues | used in many levels; meaning unknown |

The other ids are coloured by hue from the id. Each level's `level.json`
lists its surfaces and how many triangles use each.

The mesh is decoded from the level's collision block with every cell's
faces merged, so a face that straddles several cells appears once.
Vertices are quantised (1/16 unit across, 1/64 up), which leaves tiny
gaps and some doubled faces. Hero-only walls and fences (invisible walls
that only block the player) are in the block too, but they are not
extracted yet.

## Checks

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s editor                         # synthetic data only
godot --headless --path assets/godot --import
godot --headless --path assets/godot --script res://rc1/check.gd
```

The Godot check loads every level scene and compares its meshes, triangles,
textures, bounds, sky panorama and moby count with what the extractor wrote.
The collision layer is not counted with the textured meshes; its triangles
are compared with `level.json` on their own, and it must be hidden.
It also loads every moby class scene and compares their models, triangles,
textures, skeletons, bones and animations, and the meshes the placed mobys
show.

## Coverage

Extracted:

- terrain (tfrags);
- ties and shrubs, with their placements;
- moby placements, and each moby class's high-detail mesh, skeleton and
  animations;
- the sky;
- the collision mesh, as a hidden layer;
- the textures they use.

Approximations:

- Normals are flat, and Godot lights the scene. The game's own lighting,
  baked into vertex colours, is not decoded yet. Mobys use their stored
  vertex normals; the game lights them at run time.
- Alpha-tested textures become cutouts.
- Moby faces the game draws untextured get a flat grey texture, which is
  what the game binds for them. Some classes are made only of such faces
  (rings, force fields, barriers); the game may draw those translucent,
  glowing or not at all. Glow parts are lit like the rest, and the chrome
  and glass passes and the low-detail meshes are not extracted.
- Moby animations run at the game's 60 Hz tick, as ReRAC infers it. Godot
  interpolates rotation keys spherically where the game lerps, and a joint
  channel that stays within 1e-5 of the bind pose (1e-4 for rotations) is
  left out of an animation. The two helper classes 1 and 2, which animate
  joints of another skeleton, stay static. The gadget classes (the wrench
  and weapons in Ratchet's hand) are not extracted.
- The sky is baked into a 2048×1024 panorama. The game centres its sky
  shells on the camera and never moves them, so a panorama loses nothing.
  Their blending follows the PS2's usual texture and alpha modes, which is
  inferred rather than traced in the game's code. Sprites the game adds
  to the sky at run time are not included.

Not yet extracted: low-detail moby meshes, hero collision, audio, video
and each level's code overlay. [ASSETS.md](../games/rac1/pal/docs/ASSETS.md) describes
the formats and the evidence for them.
