"""Write extracted levels for the native port's level viewer (port/viewer).

Each level goes to OUT/level_NN/, with the meshes and textures the Godot
export writes (godot.py), in the same files, and two JSON files the viewer
reads in place of the Godot scene:

    manifest.json      format 1: the level, its files, its classes (mesh,
                       moby class scale and name), bounds and counts
    placements.json    ties, shrubs and mobys: class, 4x4 matrix
                       (column-major, game units and axes, Z up) and the
                       fields the game stores per instance
    terrain.glb        one node per terrain fragment
    collision.glb      the collision mesh, coloured by surface type
    ties/tie_<class>.glb, shrubs/shrub_<class>.glb
    mobys/moby_<class>.glb   mesh, skeleton (bind pose) and animations
    sky.glb            the sky's shells, one node each in drawing order,
                       with vertex colours (alpha 0x80 = 1.0, as 0..1)
    sky.png            the sky as a panorama, as for Godot
    textures/*.png     shared by every mesh

A moby placement's matrix is the instance's own (position, rotation, scale);
the class scale in the manifest multiplies in when the class mesh is drawn,
as the game does. Nothing here is ever committed (docs/policy/SOURCING.md).
