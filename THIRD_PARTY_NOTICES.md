# Third-party notices

Third-party code and data used by OpenRAC's shared components. Each game
directory lists its own in its `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and source comments:

- [games/rac1/pal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](games/rac1/pal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md):
  functions adapted from Lombyte, ReRAC's notes in `config/overlays/rerac_notes.tsv`.
- [games/rac1/ntsc/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](games/rac1/ntsc/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md):
  libgcc and soft-float, newlib, David Gay's dtoa, code ported from rac1-decomp,
  the patched EE-GCC.
- rac2 and rac3 credit their sources in their docs
  ([games/rac2/ntsc/docs/SECOND-C-LOT.md](games/rac2/ntsc/docs/SECOND-C-LOT.md),
  [games/rac2/ntsc/docs/COMPILER-NOTES.md](games/rac2/ntsc/docs/COMPILER-NOTES.md),
  [games/rac3/ntsc/docs/wiki/Cross-Repository-Resources.md](games/rac3/ntsc/docs/wiki/Cross-Repository-Resources.md)).

`port/audio/sound_player.h` follows the behaviour of OpenGOAL's 989snd
(`game/sound/989snd`; ISC License, Copyright (c) 2020-2026 OpenGOAL Team),
as do the grain type names in `port/assets/sound/sound_bank.h`.

[docs/port/OPENGOAL_NOTES.md](docs/port/OPENGOAL_NOTES.md) describes how
[OpenGOAL](https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project) (ISC, Copyright (c)
2020-2026 OpenGOAL Team) works, and the launcher's disc set-up and
`tools/extractor.py` follow how OpenGOAL's launcher and extractor behave
(their steps, folder layout and error numbers); no code from OpenGOAL is in
OpenRAC. The launcher lists its own notices in
[launcher/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](launcher/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## ReRAC

[ReRAC](https://github.com/re-rac/rerac), a native PC port of the US build,
documents the game's formats and systems. The following adapt its format code
and notes:

- `editor/mobys.py`: the moby instance record and what the level loader does
  with each field, from `crates/rc-formats/src/gameplay.rs` and
  `docs/plan/moby_render_notes.md`; described in [ASSETS.md](games/rac1/pal/docs/ASSETS.md) ("Mobys").
- `editor/moby_class.py`: the moby class header and model format (packets,
  vertex cache, skinning slots, normals, untextured faces), from
  `docs/formats/moby_rac1.md` §1-§2 and `crates/rc-formats/src/moby.rs`;
  described in [ASSETS.md](games/rac1/pal/docs/ASSETS.md) ("Moby classes").
- `editor/moby_anim.py`: moby skeletons and animation sequences, from
  `docs/formats/moby_rac1.md` §3-§4, `docs/plan/moby_animation.md` and
  `crates/rc-formats/src/moby_anim.rs`.
- `editor/collision.py`: the collision block (cell tree, packed vertices,
  faces and surface bytes), from `docs/formats/collision_rac1.md`,
  `docs/plan/collision_queries.md` and `crates/rc-formats/src/collision.rs`;
  described in [ASSETS.md](games/rac1/pal/docs/ASSETS.md) ("Collision").
- `port/assets/disc/`: the disc readers (ISO 9660, table of contents, WAD
  compression, level data, overlays, scenes, saves, messages, volumes, the
  front end), converted to C++ from `crates/rc-formats` and its specs in
  `docs/formats`; each file names its source.
- `port/assets/geometry/`: the readers of what the renderer draws (textures,
  terrain, ties, shrubs, the sky, moby classes and animation, collision and
  shadow blocks, gadgets) and the lighting passes, converted to C++ from
  `crates/rc-formats` and its specs; their tests from ReRAC's unit tests.
- `port/assets/world/`: the gameplay file, collision and its queries, occlusion,
  cameras, fonts, the HUD and PIF pictures, built on `crates/rc-formats` and
  ReRAC's specs; `port/assets/ps2_float.h` and `image.h`, shared by the parts.
- `port/assets/sound/`, `port/media/`, `port/audio/`: sound banks, VAG, PSS and
  ADPCM from `crates/rc-formats`; the MPEG-2 decoder from `crates/rc-video`;
  the voices, envelope and reverb from `crates/rc-game/src/audio`.
- `port/extract/`: `openrac-extractor`'s JSON-lines output, crash-safe writes,
  free-space check and decompile step, after `crates/rc-extract`.

## Lombyte

[Lombyte](https://github.com/lombyte-project/Lombyte), the US decompilation, now
`games/rac1/ntsc`:

- `editor/moby_classes.tsv`: the moby class names the editor shows, from its
  `config/overlays/us/names/level-NN.json` ("moby-class-record" evidence),
  which joins each level's class dispatch table with the class names of
  [Wrench](https://github.com/chaoticgd/wrench)'s moby class unpack.

## Wrench and Replanetizer

Consulted for what formats and fields mean; no code from them is included
([editor/README.md](editor/README.md#credits)):
[Wrench](https://github.com/chaoticgd/wrench) (GPL-3.0-or-later) and
[Replanetizer](https://github.com/RatchetModding/Replanetizer).

## The native port's libraries

The port ([port/](port/README.md)) builds with these libraries. CMake fetches
each at a pinned version ([port/cmake/Dependencies.cmake](port/cmake/Dependencies.cmake));
none is copied into OpenRAC.

| Library | Version | License | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) | 3.2.24 | zlib | the platform layer: window, OpenGL context, input, audio |
| [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) | 1.15 | MIT | the level viewer: reading the editor's glTF meshes |
| [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) | commit 2c980bb | MIT or public domain | the level viewer: reading textures (PNG) |

The renderer's conventions (colour 0x80 as 1.0, reversed depth, the double
draw for alpha-test fail modes, textures identified by the game's base
pointer) follow OpenGOAL's renderer as
[docs/port/OPENGOAL_NOTES.md](docs/port/OPENGOAL_NOTES.md) describes it; no
code from OpenGOAL or from any emulator is in the port.
