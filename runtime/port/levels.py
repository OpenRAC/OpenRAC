"""Where a game's functions and globals are in each level's program.

A game that loads a program of its own for each level has the same function in
each, at another address and naming other addresses: the globals it uses and
the functions it calls moved with it. The decompilation has the function once,
under the name of one place. To let that one function stand in for every copy,
the build has to know, for each level, where each name it uses is.

The retail code says so itself. Two copies of a function are the same
instructions, apart from the addresses in them: the target of a call, the two
halves of an address (`lui` and the instruction that adds the low half) and an
offset from the global pointer. Reading the same instruction in both copies
gives an address in one program and the address that stands for it in the
other. `Places` reads them from the user's own files and answers three
questions: where is a name in a level, may a function be used there, and which
places does a function have.

A frame is which program an address is in: a level's number, or None for the
program the disc boots.
