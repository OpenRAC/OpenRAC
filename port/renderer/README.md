# renderer

The port's GPU renderer, library `openrac_renderer`: OpenGL 4.1 core,
shaped after OpenGOAL's renderer
([docs/port/OPENGOAL_NOTES.md](../../docs/port/OPENGOAL_NOTES.md), sections 3
to 5) and built on what [docs/port/RENDERER.md](../../docs/port/RENDERER.md)
records about how Ratchet & Clank draws. **No emulation**: nothing here models
the console's GS, vector units, VIF or DMA. Each of the game's subsystems has
a renderer that draws its kind of thing on the GPU.

| File | What | OpenGOAL's |
|---|---|---|
| `renderer.h` | `Renderer` runs a list of `BucketRenderer`s each frame in the game's drawing order (sky, terrain, ties, shrubs, mobys, particles, HUD); `FrameInput` carries each bucket's packets and the camera | `OpenGLRenderer`, `BucketRenderer`, `SharedRenderState` |
| `direct.h` | the direct renderer: GIF packets (PACKED, REGLIST, IMAGE, A+D) of the 2D path turned into draw calls. `GifInterpreter` (CPU) assembles primitives and groups them by GPU state; `DirectRenderer` translates that state to GL: blend equation, depth test, alpha test with the double draw for fail modes, scissor, fog, texture | `DirectRenderer` |
| `texture_pool.h` | every texture as RGBA8 on the GPU, found by the base pointer in the game's TEX0 used as an **identifier**: textures converted ahead of time are `place`d there; images the game sends with IMAGE transfers are converted when first drawn and cached by content | `TexturePool` |
| `texture.h` | conversions to RGBA8: PSMCT32/24/16, PSMT8 and PSMT4 (and their "H" forms) with CLUTs in CSM1 order, TEXA alpha; the chip's block layout only for a texture uploaded in one format and read in another | `texture_conversion.h` |
| `gs.h` | the GS registers and the GIF tag as fields (public hardware documentation) | `common/dma/gs.h` |
| `subsystems.h` | placeholders for terrain (tfrag), ties, shrubs, mobys, sky and particles, each documenting what it must draw | `TFragment`, `Tie3`, `Shrub`, `Merc2`, `Sky`, `Sprite3` |
| `gl.h` | the GL functions used, loaded through the context's loader; no generated loader | glad |
| `shader.h`, `framebuffer.h`, `math.h` | GLSL programs (`#version 410 core`, samplers `tex_T<n>` bound to unit n), off-screen targets, column-major matrices with a reversed-depth projection | `Shader`, `FramebufferTexturePair` |

Shaders are in `shaders/` and compiled into the library
([cmake/Window.cmake](../cmake/Window.cmake)).

## Conventions (RENDERER.md, section 5)

- **Reversed depth**: the depth buffer is cleared to 0 and tested GEQUAL; the
  chip's Z, bigger nearer, goes straight to GL's window depth.
- **Colour 0x80 = 1.0** when modulating: the direct shader works in the chip's
  units (texel × vertex / 128, alpha 0x80 opaque) and writes alpha / 128.
- **Alpha-test fail modes** (FB_ONLY, ZB_ONLY, RGB_ONLY) by drawing twice:
  passing pixels with every write, then failing ones with only what the mode
  keeps; ATST NEVER draws once with the fail mode's writes.
- **Textures** are converted once and identified by their base pointer, never
  by an address in a model of the chip's 4 MB memory.

## Placeholders and gaps

The world renderers (`subsystems.h`) draw nothing yet: they need the game's
camera, visibility and lights, which come with the decompiled frame loop.
The level viewer ([viewer/](../viewer/README.md)) already draws the extracted
terrain, ties, shrubs, moby bind poses and sky.

The direct renderer covers the registers the 2D path uses. Not drawn
differently yet: region clamp and repeat (drawn as clamp), CSM2 CLUTs,
uploads into the middle of a buffer, local-to-local GS copies (ignored, as in
OpenGOAL), partial frame-buffer masks (a channel is masked only when all its
bits are), DATE, dithering. The hand-off from the game (which bytes reach
`FrameInput`, DESIGN.md section 4, item 3) is still open.

## Tests

`renderer_texture` (conversions, layout, pool), `renderer_gif` (the
interpreter) run anywhere; `renderer_direct` draws packets into a framebuffer
and checks pixels, through SDL's offscreen driver (Mesa's llvmpipe without a
GPU), and reports itself skipped when no OpenGL 4.1 context can be made.
