// The port's developer features (the launcher's developer mode: OPENRAC_DEVELOPER=1; without it
// the menus are exactly the game's). In Ratchet & Clank PAL the front end's Options list gets a
// "Planets" entry, a page of the game's own making that lists the levels and starts the one
// picked. As a fallback, a level selector the port draws itself over the title and main menu:
// F1 (or Select on a pad) opens it while the boot program runs; Up and Down pick a level,
// Return / Space / Cross starts it, F1 / Backspace / Triangle closes it. The level is started the
// way --level N with OPENRAC_DIRECT does (game/rac1-pal/host/boot.c): NewGameInit for that level,
// then the menus closed and the start flag set, so the game loads it as a new game's first level.
//
// OPENRAC_DEBUG_MENU=FRAME opens it at that window frame (for scripted checks).
