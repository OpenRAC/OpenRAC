 * Ratchet & Clank (PAL): small hand-written assembly routines of the level programs, in C.
 *
 * Like the vector routines in vector.c, these are not compiler output in the retail program
 * (trapping adds, $at as a working register, FPU conversions that never leave the FPU), so the
 * decompilation keeps them as assembly. Each function here was written from the instructions of
 * the routine it is named after and does what those do to memory and to the result register.
 * Only routines that take their arguments and give their result as compiled code does are here:
 * some of the game's assembly passes values in other registers, which C cannot say.

 * into the next field. The new word is also the result.
