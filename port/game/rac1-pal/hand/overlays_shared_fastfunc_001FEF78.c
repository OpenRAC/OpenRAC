 * Ratchet & Clank (PAL): the game's small vector and number routines, in C.
 *
 * In the retail program these are hand-written assembly for the EE's vector
 * unit (VU0 macro instructions) and FPU, so the decompilation keeps them as
 * assembly: no C compiles to them. The port needs them in C all the same, and
 * they are the most called code in the game. Each function here was written
 * from the instructions of the routine it is named after and does what those
 * do to memory and to the result register, operation for operation and in the
 * same order, so that rounding agrees; the build's check runs both and
 * compares (runtime/port/README.md).
 *
 * What they do not reproduce is what the routines leave in the vector unit's
 * own registers. A routine whose result depends on what an earlier one left
 * there (the cross product stores a fourth field it never computed) is not
 * here.
 *
 * A vector is four floats, x first. The assembly loads all 128 bits of its
 * operands before it stores, so every function reads all it needs first: the
 * result may be one of the operands.
