# The native port

OpenRAC's native PC port: the decompiled games built for a PC and drawn by
a renderer of OpenRAC's own, the way [OpenGOAL](https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project)
ported Jak and Daxter. **No emulation**: nothing here runs the retail
program or models the console's processors, GS, vector units or DMA
controller. The design, the studies behind it and the order of work are in
[docs/port](../docs/port/README.md).

```sh
cd port
cmake --preset release            # fetches SDL3 when the system has none
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/hostgen    # the translator's tests
```

You need CMake 3.24+, Ninja, Clang (it builds the port, and hostgen uses it
to read the decompilation) and Python 3. `--preset headless` builds without
a window (no SDL3): the runtime, the games and their tests.

To build a game's program without any of that by hand, run
`python3 tools/build_port.py [GAME] [--source DIR]` from the top of OpenRAC:
the launcher's "Build the game" runs it. It configures `build/release` the
first time and then builds only what changed. On Windows it sets up Visual
Studio's x64 environment itself (the MSVC libraries and the Windows SDK) and
finds Clang and Ninja. `--source` builds from your own copy of the
decompilation and is remembered by the build folder.

## What is here

| Directory | |
|---|---|
| [runtime/](runtime) | game memory, laid out as the console's (a 4 GB reservation whose offsets are its addresses), the contract translated code is written against ([guest.h](runtime/include/openrac/guest.h)), the executable's data loader, the crash handler |
| [tools/hostgen/](tools/hostgen/README.md) | writes a decompilation's C again for game memory: pointers as 32-bit game addresses, calls matched to their definitions as the EE passed arguments, calls through code addresses. It reports the frontier: what the program reaches that has no C |
| [game/](game/README.md) | the games, one directory per version (`rac1-pal`, `rac1-ntsc`, `rac2-ntsc`, `rac3-ntsc`, `rac4-ntsc`): each its hostgen configuration and the table of the libraries it calls. [game/common/](game/common) is what they share: the library replacements (disc, memory card, graphics hand-off, kernel, pads, sound) and the program, `openrac-<id>` |
| [platform/](platform) | the window, input as the console's pad, audio output, timing (SDL3) |
| [renderer/](renderer) | the renderer: per-subsystem renderers in OpenGOAL's manner, the direct renderer for the 2D path, texture conversion (OpenGL 4.1) |
| [viewer/](viewer) | `openrac-viewer`: a level, extracted from the player's disc by the editor, drawn natively with a free camera |
| [common/](common) | the log |
| [tests/](tests) | the runtime's tests |

## How a game is built

```
games/rac1/pal (the decompilation, read only)
   │  hostgen: Clang reads each file as the console's C,
   │  hostgen writes it again for game memory
   ▼
build/.../games/rac1-pal/gen/*.c  +  game/common/lib/*.c (library replacements, shared)
                                 +  game/rac1-pal/host/*.c (the game's own, if any)
   │  compiled as C, linked with runtime/
   ▼
openrac-rac1-pal --data <install>/active/rac1/data
   loads the player's executable's data to its addresses, registers every
   function by code address, runs the game's main()
```

The program stops at the first function that has no C yet and names it.
For OpenRAC's decompilation that is the boot stage, still assembly; a copy
of the decompilation that is further along builds the same way
(`-DOPENRAC_RAC1_PAL_SOURCE=<dir>`), and hostgen's report says what it reaches
next.

Every version in [game/](game/README.md) is built the same way when its
decompilation is present. The other four build today but do not run yet:
their `main` is not identified and their library tables are partly or not
filled; [game/README.md](game/README.md) says what each needs.

## Direct level probes (RAC1 PAL)

For development, `OPENRAC_DIRECT=1` with `--level 0` starts a fresh game
in Veldin once the title world has initialized. It calls NewGameInit and
the normal level loader without menu input. Add `--skip-movies` to return
the movie player's skipped result immediately, including for intros.
Every skipped movie is logged. This flag is off by default.

From a configured PowerShell build environment, for example:

```powershell
$env:OPENRAC_DIRECT = '1'
$env:OPENRAC_PRESS = '100:4000:5' # acknowledge the initial no-card warning
.\build\release\openrac-rac1-pal.exe --data <extracted-data> --window --no-card --level 0 --skip-movies --stop-on-missing
Remove-Item Env:OPENRAC_DIRECT
Remove-Item Env:OPENRAC_PRESS
```

Use an isolated card directory if testing saves. Direct probes exercise
fresh-game level loading, not saved progression or menu/movie playback.
Keep `--stop-on-missing` enabled and also run the normal New Game path
without these shortcuts when validating startup behavior.

To diagnose controller input, set `OPENRAC_TRACE_INPUT=1`: it logs the pad
report passed to the game every 25 frontend frames in which a port is read,
including scripted input. With `OPENRAC_DEBUG=1`, RAC1 PAL also logs the
processed pad state and stick axes every 100 frontend frames. Compare these
with the player position to distinguish device input from game-state bugs.

## Rules

OpenRAC's rules hold here ([AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md),
[SOURCING.md](../docs/policy/SOURCING.md)): nothing from a disc is ever
committed (no data, code bytes, microcode or media), and the library
replacements are written from what the game's own code shows and what is
publicly known of each API, never from Sony's code or documentation.
Generated C and build output stay in build trees (`port/build/` is ignored).
The C and C++ layout is [.clang-format](.clang-format); comments say why.

GPL-3.0-or-later, as the rest of OpenRAC's top level.
