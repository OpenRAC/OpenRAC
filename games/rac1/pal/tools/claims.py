"""
Shared claims, so several agents (Claude waves, a GPT agent, a person) can
match and land in one checkout without doing the same function twice or
overwriting each other's files (docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md, "Several agents
at once").

  python3 tools/claims.py claim OWNER func_X [func_Y ...]   # take them
  python3 tools/claims.py release OWNER func_X [...]        # give them back
  python3 tools/claims.py who func_X [...]                  # who holds each
  python3 tools/claims.py list [OWNER]                      # all claims, or one owner's
  python3 tools/claims.py lock OWNER                        # take the landing lock
  python3 tools/claims.py unlock OWNER                      # release it

A claim is the file build-sn/claims/<func>, holding its owner and the
time. Creating it is atomic, so of two agents claiming one function only
one gets it: `claim` prints `claimed` or `taken by <owner>` per function
and exits 1 if any was taken. Claim a function before working on it,
release it when you give up on it, and leave it claimed once it is
matched (it stays done). OWNER is any short name without spaces:
`gpt`, `claude`, a wave worker's `q7:k03`.

The landing lock (build-sn/claims/LANDING/) serialises writes to src/:
take it before changing a source file, release it right after. A lock
older than LOCK_STALE seconds is taken as abandoned and broken. It is a
directory, not an flock, so it works the same on the Mac and inside the
build container, which share the checkout through a bind mount.

Standard library only: runs on the host and in the container.
