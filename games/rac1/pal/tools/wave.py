Plans, tracks and integrates waves of worker agents (docs/WORKER.md).

  python3 tools/wave.py plan NAME [--role match|compile] [--count N]
                         [--budget N] [--near | --fresh | --overlay] [func_X ...]
      Picks functions (the ones named, or from tools/triage.py), writes each
      one's CONTEXT.md and m2c sketch, starts a fresh BUDGET of try_func
      runs, and prints each worker's one-line prompt.
  python3 tools/wave.py plan NAME --queue [--min-size N] [--max-size N] ...
      A queue wave (docs/QUEUE.md): workers take several functions each.
  python3 tools/wave.py claim NAME ID [--count N]
      For a queue worker: claims the next N functions and prints each
      one's packet (dossier, assembly, matched C to start from).
  python3 tools/wave.py tokens NAME
      Tokens per worker and per match, from the sub-agent transcripts.
  python3 tools/wave.py status NAME
      One line per function: verdict, runs used, best candidate.
  python3 tools/wave.py integrate NAME
      Applies the EXACT results through tools/integrate.py (in Docker).
      Run the full build afterwards, as always.
  python3 tools/wave.py land NAME [--batch] [--reject func_X ...]
      (--batch, overlay waves: apply and re-check every EXACT, leave the
      report and the one commit to the lead; --reject skips matches the
      lead's review turned down.)
      For each EXACT result, one at a time: integrate it, run the full build,
      check it added one exact function and no size mismatch, regenerate the
      progress report and commit that function alone. A failure restores the
      source file and moves on. Needs src/ and progress/ clean.

  python3 tools/wave.py long NAME func_X ... [--arm opus] [--budget 30]
      Sets up long-function workers (docs/LONG_FUNCTIONS.md): each
      function's dossier, m2c sketch and PACKET.md, and a BUDGET in its
      build-sn/try/<func>/<arm>/ folder; prints one prompt per function.
      Refuses a function rank_candidates blocks.
  python3 tools/wave.py stage [--level NN] [--max F] [func_X ...]
      Shares near misses (docs/NONMATCHING.md): each overlay stub's closest
      attempt within --max (a fraction of the bytes; default 0.15) goes to
      nonmatching/<dir>/<func>.c through tools/nonmatching.py, unless the
      staged one is already as close. Packets start from it; landing the
      function removes it.
  python3 tools/wave.py salvage [--ports] [--level NN] [--reject func_X ...]
      Lands every overlay stub that already has an EXACT run logged in
      build-sn/try (a wave stopped before landing, a file that clashed
      then): batch-landed like `land --batch`. Candidates crediting Lombyte
      are left out unless --ports, which lands only those, so the two go in
      separate commits. --level NN keeps to func_LNN_ functions: another
      agent may own another level's work. Salvages of different levels
      (and --ports beside a plain one) run at once: each has its own
      manifests and lock owner, writes take the landing lock only while
      writing, and files that land one by one do so four at a time.

--near picks earlier attempts that came close (BYTES within 40, a size
within 8 bytes, or a near-miss in src/); --fresh, the default, picks
functions nobody has tried, smallest first. Waves are recorded in
build-sn/waves/NAME.json.

--overlay --near is a near wave (docs/QUEUE.md, "Near misses"): overlay
stubs whose best attempt came within --near-max of retail (a fraction of
the bytes; default 0.10) or within 8 bytes of its size, closest first.
Each one's best candidate is kept as build-sn/try/<func>/best.c, and
tools/near_diffs.py writes what still differs to BEST_DIFF.txt; both go in
the packet.

A run's chance of an EXACT falls with every run spent on the same function
(waves q6-q26: about 12% for runs 1-5, 8% for 6-10, 3-4% after), so the
default budget is 6: what's left of a function is a near wave's job.

Overlay functions (func_LNN_XXXXXXXX, docs/OVERLAYS.md) are a separate
pool: named explicitly (func_L00_... on the command line, same as any
other function) or picked with --overlay, which orders the catalogue's
shared-and-level functions the way docs/OVERLAYS.md's "Relatives" section
recommends -- shared code present in all 19 levels first, smaller first --
after screening asm/overlays/<name>.s through rank_candidates' blocked
patterns and skipping anything already matched. A wave is either all
overlay names or all executable ones, never mixed. `land` treats an
overlay wave differently (see land_overlay()): no full build (the
executable does not link src/overlays/), and progress/report.json does
not count overlay functions yet -- see the TODO where it's called.
