"""
Audits EVERY function that has real C in src/*.c (i.e. is no longer an
INCLUDE_ASM stub) against retail, on BOTH size and bytes.

This exists because per-function spot checks let two distinct classes of
false positive through:
  * a stale object after a failed compile (the INCLUDE_ASM stub still
    holds retail's own bytes, so it reads 0/N), and
  * a function correct in its first N bytes but LONGER than retail (the
    surplus fell outside the compared window, so it also read 0/N).
Both were caught only by accident. A whole-project sweep with explicit
size comparison is the cheap way to keep them caught.

Run after a full rebuild+relink. Reports one line per function and a
summary, and exits nonzero if anything is not a clean match.

Usage: python tools/sweep_matches.py

    729 of the .s files have some, because retail aligns the next function

    still an INCLUDE_ASM stub its .s supplies that padding; the moment it
    is decompiled to C, the padding silently disappears and every later
    function in the object shifts, producing spurious 1-byte `jal` diffs
    far away from the actual cause. One instance of this shifted 179
    functions at once -- 179 apparent problems, one real cause.
