Add the nops retail's assembler added, to compiled game code.

Retail's text segment was assembled by SN Systems' own ps2eeas, not the
GNU as this build uses, and ps2eeas inserts nops GNU as does not.
core_text was assembled by the same GNU as the build runs (the compiler
driver's ee/bin/as.exe), so this runs on src/game/ objects, plus
989snd.o, whose retail code has ps2eeas's short-loop padding on loops
with calls (func_0012E688, func_0012EC60). Three rules:

1. Short loops (the R5900 short-loop erratum). Every backward branch
   whose loop -- the target through the branch itself -- is shorter than
   six instructions gets nops right before the branch until it is
   exactly six. Measured on ps2eeas directly (tools in the toolchain
   mirrors): in reorder and noreorder code alike, branch-likely too,
   counting any other instructions in the loop, delay slots included.
   This is why 309 of retail's backward branches span exactly six
   instructions. The driver's as.exe already pads loops that contain no
   call, in the first-pass object this measures, so in effect this adds
   the padding ps2eeas also gives loops with a call.

   The driver's as.exe measures differently, though: it counts from the
   target label to the first jump after it, not to the branch. On a
   backward branch that is not a loop -- a cross-jump back into a short
   block that returns -- it pads where ps2eeas did not (func_00209188:
   three nops). Where GNU as gave a branch more nops than ps2eeas's rule,
   the branch is written as a `.word` with its offset computed from the
   label, which GNU as cannot pad, and gets ps2eeas's padding instead.
   Only branches in the compiler's noreorder blocks, whose delay slot is
   spelled out, are rewritten.

2. FP compare then branch. A `c.cond.fmt` immediately followed by a
   `bc1*` gets a nop between them. In retail text the pair is never
   adjacent (191 of 191 have the nop). GNU as adds one on its own in
   some contexts and not in others (not when the compiler leaves an
   unfilled bc1 in reorder mode), so the pairs are found in the
   assembled object, never guessed from the source.

3. GPR to FPU move. An `mtc1 $x, $fN` -- written out or from an `li.s`
   expansion -- immediately followed by an instruction that reads $fN
   gets a nop between them, in reorder code (215 times in retail text;
   the 17 adjacent pairs are all in hand-written noreorder code). GNU
   as never adds this one. Sites must be found alike in the object and in
   the source, or the tool refuses to guess. fastfunc.o is skipped: its
   retail code is hand-written noreorder assembly (every mtc1 there is
   directly followed by its reader), even where our C reproduces it.

ps2eeas itself cannot be used here: it recurses without end on some of
the retail stubs that INCLUDE_ASM feeds it, and it has no -G small-data
expansion (docs/DECOMP_PROGRESS.md).

Two passes, so that nothing is guessed about macro expansion or delay
slots: IN.o is IN.s assembled. Everything is measured in it, per compiled
function (the INCLUDE_ASM stubs are retail's bytes and already padded),
and the nops go into IN.s before the matching branch. A loop's span
counts the FP nops inserted inside it.
