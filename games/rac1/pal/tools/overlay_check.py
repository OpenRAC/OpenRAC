"""
Strict verdict for a level overlay function (func_LNN_XXXXXXXX): unlike
try_func's masked compare for executable functions, EXACT here means every
relocation in the candidate's compiled object reaches the exact retail
address, not just that the instruction words match with link-dependent
fields masked out (docs/OVERLAYS.md, "Plan" step 2).

  python tools/overlay_check.py OBJ.o func_LNN_XXXXXXXX [--diff]

OBJ.o is an ELF relocatable object built the way tools/try_func.py builds
one (the "text" segment pipeline): its .text holds the function (and,
for a stub that branches into its neighbour, that neighbour too) as
unlinked code with REL relocations still pending.

check(obj_path, name, show=False) is the entry point tools/try_func.py
calls; the __main__ block below is only a thin CLI over it for standalone
use.

Placement and resolution (docs/OVERLAYS.md, "Names" and "Layout"):

  - The object's .text is placed so NAME's symbol lands at its canonical
    address (level NN, address XXXXXXXX -- read straight out of the name).
  - Every relocation touching NAME's bytes is resolved and applied in
    Python (R_MIPS_26, R_MIPS_HI16/LO16 with standard REL pairing,
    R_MIPS_GPREL16 against _gp = 0x166D00, R_MIPS_32); anything else is
    reported as an unknown type.
  - A symbol's address in level NN: func_LMM_Y/D_LMM_Y/jtbl_LMM_Y is Y when
    MM == NN; a func_LMM_Y with MM != NN, or an executable func_Y catalogued
    as kind "exe", is looked up in config/overlays/functions.tsv for its
    place in level NN (an error if it has none there); func_Y/D_Y below
    0x15F000 are resident and equal Y; _gp is 0x166D00. Anything else is
    unresolved -> verdict LINK.
  - A relocation against a section symbol (.text local labels, .rodata)
    resolves through that section's own placed base plus the relocation's
    in-place addend.
  - If the function's relocated references into its own object's .rodata
    (a switch's jump table, a float constant) all land on the same single
    local offset, that table is placed at the retail address its own
    asm/overlays/<name>.s names as jtbl_LNN_Z (MM == NN); with more than
    one distinct table referenced, or none named, the verdict is RODATA.

The final, relocated bytes are compared byte for byte (no masking) against
baserom/overlays/level_NN/text.bin at the function's address (minus the
"text" record's own address, from manifest.json), for the catalogue's
recorded size.

Verdicts, in try_func's vocabulary: EXACT, BYTES n/size (n differing
bytes; --diff lists the differing instruction offsets, retail vs ours),
SIZE ours/retail, plus LINK <names> and RODATA <detail>.
