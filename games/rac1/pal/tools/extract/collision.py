"""Static collision: the level's baked world mesh, as triangles with surface types.

The layout follows ReRAC's notes on the format (docs/ASSETS.md, "Collision").
A three-level tree (Z, then Y, then X) of 4-unit cells leads to leaves; each
leaf has its own packed vertices and the faces that touch the cell, so a face
that spans several cells is stored once per cell and is merged here.
