/* Reclaimed from a banked revert. The old note blamed retail's
   dsll32/dsra32 on a sign-extension this compiler "does not emit for an
   int-returning callee" -- right observation, wrong conclusion. The pair is
   not an extension of an int, it is the DImode->SImode narrowing GCC emits
   when a 64-bit return value is assigned to an int (`long` is 64 bits for
   this target, though word_mode is still SI -- which is why a 64-bit
   *compare* is rejected outright with "unsupported wide integer operation").
   So the callee was prototyped `long` where it is called and defined `int`
   where it is defined: an inconsistency retail could have, because these two
   functions lived in different translation units and nothing cross-checks
   them at link time. We merge the whole segment into one file, so the two
   views are reconciled with an asm-labelled alias -- func_00116108 keeps its
   int definition (it stays byte-exact; widening it is impossible anyway,
   since its own `r == -1` would become an unsupported 64-bit compare) and
   the call site goes through a declaration that spells the return type the
   way retail's header did. Emits a plain `jal func_00116108`. */
