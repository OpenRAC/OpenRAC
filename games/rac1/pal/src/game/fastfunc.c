/*
 * REVERTED to INCLUDE_ASM deliberately, and this one matters beyond

 *
 * They are max.s/min.s single-instruction wrappers. Retail is 8 bytes
 * each (max.s scheduled into the jr's delay slot). Written as inline asm
 * this compiler emits 12 bytes -- jr first, then the asm in dead-code
 * position, because inline asm is opaque to its scheduler. So they were
 * never matches; they were 4 bytes LONGER than retail each.
 *
 * A non-matching function that is *longer* than retail shifts every
 * later function in the segment, so these two were silently adding 8
 * bytes of drift to every downstream address reference in text.c --
 * func_001F7B40, for instance, was instruction-for-instruction identical
 * to retail yet reported 1/44 purely because its `jal` target had moved.
 * Reverting them restores the stubs' exact retail bytes and removes that
 * drift.
 *
 * General rule this establishes: a size-mismatched function should be
 * reverted to INCLUDE_ASM, not kept as documented-close C. Byte-diff
 * near-misses of the same size are harmless to keep; longer ones corrupt
 * verification for everything after them. (This is the same failure mode
 * as the old core_text func_00112380 drift, which is why that one was
 * worth fixing rather than tolerating.)
