/* NON_MATCHING func_L00_001F3AF0 -- src/overlays/shared/draw_001F3A78.c
 * Best so far: SIZE ours 620 / retail 624, checked 2026-10-03.
 * Not built into anything: the retail assembly stays in the source file
 * until a candidate is EXACT (docs/NONMATCHING.md). Start from this one.
 * What the last attempts found:
 *   func_L00_001F3AF0: appends a line of font glyph quads (x, y, color, string) to the packet buffer D_L00_0016128
 *   p8.c (620 vs 624) has the same instruction sequence as retail: loop body, constants, stores all match in order
 *   Tried: one variable for packet pointer in prologue and loop (gives retail's `daddu $9,$2,$0`), `qw = 5` just b
