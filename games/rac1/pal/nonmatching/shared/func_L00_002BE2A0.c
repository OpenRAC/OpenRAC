/* NON_MATCHING func_L00_002BE2A0 -- src/overlays/shared/vendor_002BA7C8.c
 * Best so far: SIZE ours 252 / retail 260, checked 2026-10-06.
 * Not built into anything: the retail assembly stays in the source file
 * until a candidate is EXACT (docs/NONMATCHING.md). Start from this one.
 * What the last attempts found:
 *   Rebuilds camera tables: if D_L00_0016188C is set, clears it, computes f = D_L00_001617AC / func_001FA888(12), 
 *   Wall: D_L00_0016188C is read via lui/lw and written via gp-rel; one .extern size decides both (2 = gp read, 4 
 *   Would need the original's declaration of that flag (likely a header with another type) and the true statement 
 *   mini13/a03 three-identical stop: p7 corrected flag macro/exact DC260 alias, p8 reversed pointer increments, p9
 *   Rebuilds camera tables; remaining source base+16 is folded, initialization lacks retail nop, and trailing poin
