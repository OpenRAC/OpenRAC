/* NON_MATCHING func_L00_0024F170 -- src/overlays/shared/missionfunc_0024EEF0.c
 * Best so far: SIZE ours 80 / retail 84, checked 2026-10-06.
 * Not built into anything: the retail assembly stays in the source file
 * until a candidate is EXACT (docs/NONMATCHING.md). Start from this one.
 * What the last attempts found:
 *   Selects mission status from two flags and an enable byte.
 *   Stopped at repeated lui wall: p2 repeats D_0013D5CA high address; base retention and return control also diffe
 *   A per-function compiler flag investigation would unblock this.
