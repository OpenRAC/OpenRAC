/* NON_MATCHING func_L18_002F1444 -- src/overlays/l18_veldin2/vendor_002A8400.c
 * Best so far: SIZE ours 200 / retail 204, checked 2026-10-03.
 * Not built into anything: the retail assembly stays in the source file
 * until a candidate is EXACT (docs/NONMATCHING.md). Start from this one.
 * What the last attempts found:
 *   (not run). Landing needs line 137 changed to a 4-byte MACRO_ADDR declaration (2D8140 reads it through
 *   `*(char **)&D_L18_00160058`, which would still work with a cast).
 *   2. Missing `nop` (4 bytes) before the inner loop: retail's function starts at 0x...444 (4 mod 8; it is the
 *   interior of one function with func_L18_002F1420, which jumps into it with $9 = list, $12 = a0), so the
 *   .p2align 3 of the inner loop pads one nop. Standalone gcc aligns the function to 8, so no pad. The pair
 *   should be written as ONE C function (2F1420 + 2F1444, 228 bytes): table lookup D_L18_001AC540[a1], return 1
 *   if null, then this body ($12 = a0 is `val`, which is the uninitialised value stored at data+0x16C).
 *   Not verified combined (try_func only swaps one function).
