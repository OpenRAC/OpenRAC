/* NON_MATCHING func_L14_002DF5F8 -- src/overlays/l14_oltanis/vendor_002ACCC0.c
 * Best so far: SIZE ours 200 / retail 192, checked 2026-10-09.
 * Not built into anything: the retail assembly stays in the source file
 * until a candidate is EXACT (docs/NONMATCHING.md). Start from this one.
 * What the last attempts found:
 *   That is the 4-byte shortfall.
 *   3. Register numbers agree with retail in p4/p5/p7/p8 (rotation $17, data $16).
 *   Diagnosis: a coalescing/allocator tie between the qcopy source temporary and
 *   the rotation variable (gcc 2.95 -O2). None of the source wordings changed the
 *   tie. Stopped at the rule-7 point (more than three variants in a row at the same
 *   bytes). A way out would need a source form that keeps the qcopy source
 *   temporary from being coalesced with the variable. I did not find one with
 *   plain C.
