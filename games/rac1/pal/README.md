A work-in-progress **matching decompilation** of *Ratchet & Clank* (Insomniac Games, 2002) for the PlayStation 2 (`SCES_509.16`, PAL v2.00), part of the **[OpenRAC](https://openrac.dev)** initiative.

The objective is to produce C/C++ source code that, when compiled with the original toolchain, generates a byte-identical copy of the retail executable. Matched code is then refactored toward readable, idiomatic C++ with accurate types and naming, using matching builds as continuous regression tests.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains **no game assets, retail executables, or disassembly**. To build, you must provide your own legally obtained copy of the game. Please review [`LEGAL.md`](LEGAL.md) before contributing.

## Progress

Decompilation progress is tracked live on **[openrac.dev](https://openrac.dev)** and **[decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp](https://decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp)**.

| Version | Region | Target ID | Code Matched | Functions Matched |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v2.00 | PAL (En, Fr, De, Es, It) | `SCES_509.16` | [![](https://decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp.svg?mode=shield&label=Code&measure=matched_code_percent)](https://decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp) | [![](https://decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp.svg?mode=shield&label=Functions&measure=matched_functions)](https://decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp) |

Every function links at its original retail address. Functions not yet decompiled are built from disassembly, ensuring the full binary always links and matches retail byte-for-byte outside in-progress functions. For level overlays and breakdown details, see [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp) and [`docs/OVERLAYS.md`](docs/OVERLAYS.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Linux & macOS**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) (uses our prebuilt Wine container via GitHub Container Registry).
- **Windows**: Git Bash, Python 3.10+, and community toolchain mirrors.

### Setup & Build

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenRAC/rac1-decomp.git
   cd rac1-decomp
   ```
   *(On Windows, keep the directory path short to avoid path length limits in the legacy toolchain's `make`.)*

2. **Provide your original executable:**
   Copy `SCES_509.16` from your disc image into `baserom/`:
   ```bash
   # Expected SHA-1: 79956931bd62fafd8d20fa2eae796dbaf2e15e83
   cp /path/to/SCES_509.16 baserom/SCES_509.16
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and fetch toolchains:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (native):
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   bash tools/setup_asm.sh
   git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/SN-Systems-ProDG_for_PS2_3.01 toolchain/sn-prodg-3.01
   git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/sce_ps2_sdk_24 toolchain/sn-prodg-24

   # Linux & macOS (via container wrapper):
   bash tools/docker/run.sh bash tools/setup_asm.sh
   git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/SN-Systems-ProDG_for_PS2_3.01 toolchain/sn-prodg-3.01
   git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/sce_ps2_sdk_24 toolchain/sn-prodg-24
   ```

4. **Build and verify:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (native):
   bash tools/build_sn.sh

   # Linux & macOS (via container):
   bash tools/docker/run.sh bash tools/build_sn.sh
   ```
