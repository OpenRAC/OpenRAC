/*
 * Keeps a variable OUT of the small-data area.
 *
 * Retail addresses some globals via $gp (the MIPS small-data area, base
 * 0x00166D00 from its own .reginfo, window 0x15ED00..0x16ED00). To
 * reproduce those we must build with a nonzero -G, but that makes the
 * compiler use $gp for EVERY small global -- including the ~60 that live
 * far outside the window, whose references then can't reach
 * ("relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GPREL16").
 *
 * Placement is decided per variable by its declared size, but the
 * incomplete-array trick (`extern char x[];`) changes how the variable
 * must be spelled at every use site, which is unacceptable for scalars
 * inside already-matching functions. An explicit section attribute
 * achieves the same thing while leaving use sites untouched: the
 * compiler knows the variable isn't in .sdata and falls back to lui/lo.
 *
 * Verified directly: a plain `extern unsigned char x;` compiles to
 * `lbu $v0,0($gp)` at -G8, the same declaration with this macro compiles
 * to `lui`/`lbu`. (`aligned` does NOT work -- it stays gp-relative.)

/*
 * Loads a global with retail's one-register form:
 *     lui $2,%hi(D) / lw $2,%lo(D)($2)
 * where plain declarations give the split form this compiler prefers:
 *     lui $2,%hi(D) / lw $3,%lo(D)($2)
 *
 * The section name makes the compiler treat the symbol as small data, so
 * it emits the unsplit assembler macro `lw $2,D`. The declared size is
 * still over -G2, so the assembler does not use $gp for it and expands the
 * macro through the destination register. The register choice around the
 * load follows, because the compiler allocated one pseudo, not two.
 *
 * Loads only. A store to such a symbol becomes a two-instruction macro
 * (`lui $at` / `sw`) that the compiler still counts as one instruction, so
 * it can land in a delay slot; the assembler then warns "macro used after
 * .set nomacro". Check the make log for that warning.

 * (which uses $6). Each address goes into its own register and is read at
 * offset 0, which no C copy reproduces: a long long or aligned-struct copy
 * folds the offset into lq/sq. First matched on func_001ECC10 (camera.c).
 *
 * This is the one sanctioned inline asm. Candidates call it; they never
 * write asm inside a function themselves (tools/integrate.py refuses that).
