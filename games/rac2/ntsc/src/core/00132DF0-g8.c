   twin). A bare command goes out at once through the command RPC when nothing is
   queued or pending; otherwise it waits for room in the current batch, appends the
   command and its data, and records the callback for its reply. -G8 by the file
   name: the batch tables are sized sda arrays ($gp addresses); the RPC client and
   its reply buffer are sda incomplete arrays, rebuilt at each use as retail does. */
