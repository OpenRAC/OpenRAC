/* snd_StreamSafeCdRead (rac1-decomp src/core/989snd.c). This unit needs
   -mno-split-addresses for the absolute `lui $at; sw` stores and for the return-zero
   constant in the beq's delay slot.

   D_001A7100 and D_001A7110 are the count and error fields of RAC1's CdSafeState
   (sound_read_work), which declares them volatile with these types at offsets 0 and
   0x10; func_00133580 polls the count. Two volatile stores depend on each other, which
   raises the first store's scheduling priority above the two address loads, so it goes
   first; the second then ranks behind the remaining load, having fewer dependents.
   Without volatile all four tie on priority and the loads, with more dependents, go
   first. */
