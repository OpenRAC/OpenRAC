/* snd_BankLoadByLoc and snd_BankLoadFromIOP (989snd): synchronous bank loads over RPC.

   Both end by waiting for the RPC reply word, which RAC1 writes as a plain
   if/do-while. Here that spelling gets one NOP too many: retail's wait loop reads the
   word with two instructions and is padded by words, while this compiler's padding
   pass counts a macro load as one insn. So the loop reads through D_001A7180_abs, a
   split %hi/%lo pair that counts as two, and has to keep that %hi inside the loop:
   - the jump to `done` enters the loop from outside, so loop.c leaves it alone; it
     is still a real loop, whose label keeps retail's .p2align 3. Nothing is hoisted,
     so the sentinel is a local set in front of the loop;
   - -fno-gcse stops PRE hoisting the %hi instead.
   -fno-cse-follow-jumps keeps the separate read at `reread`, which reorg moves into
   the branch's delay slot, where retail reads the reply again through $gp. */
