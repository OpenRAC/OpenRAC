/* func_002887B0: the switch only sets a flag (retail's jump table lands on one shared

 * -0x6798), not the one at 0x139688. */
/* func_002887B0 (near miss, boot 0x002887B0, 188 bytes, 28 places).
 *
 * The dispatch arm of the class-record updaters in game/002880E0.c.  Retail:
 * if the record's word at +0 is zero, return 0; otherwise call
 * func_00287FF8(id, kind) with kind 1 for ids 0xC, 0xE, 0x11, 0x12 and 0x35
 * and kind 2 for everything else (including out-of-range ids), then clear the
 * count word at 0x139688[id] when the call returned 0 and return that value.
 *
 * The switch is real: retail builds a 42-entry table at 0x26C6F0 covering
 * 0xC..0x35, and the five ids above are its only entries that are not the
 * default target.  Two measured spellings, both 0 of 28 places:
 *
 *   1. one call site per arm (below): 184 bytes, exact table span and
 *      default, but this cc1 hoists the shared `$a0 = $s0` above the split
 *      (retail has it only on the kind-1 edge);
 *   2. `int flag = 0; switch (...) { case <5 ids>: flag = 1; break; default:
 *      break; } result = func_00287FF8(a0, flag ? 1 : 2);` - also 184 bytes,
 *      and it reproduces the single call but this cc1 lowers the ternary with
 *      `movz` and puts the flag in `$a3`, where retail tests the flag in
 *      `$a1` (`addiu $a1,$zero,1` in the case block, then `beqz $a1`) because
 *      its flag and its argument were coalesced into the same register.
 *
 * What was learned and is worth keeping: the table span comes from the
 * extreme *case labels* (0xC and 0x35), not from the default, and the two
 * arms share one call - so the source had a single call with a conditional
 * second argument, and the remaining difference is that register coalescing.
