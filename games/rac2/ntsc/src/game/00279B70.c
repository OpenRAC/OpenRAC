/* func_00279B70: the per-level table is a two-dimensional array (0x400 bytes a level) and

 * Takes a three-bit field out of the byte at the given index (the high nibble's low three
 * bits for an odd index, the low three bits for an even one), looks that field up in a
 * table, and scales the byte found there: times the scale, over 100. */
