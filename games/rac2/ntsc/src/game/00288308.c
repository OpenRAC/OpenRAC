/* func_00288308: the two per-class flag tables are sda arrays, which -G0 addresses with

/* func_00288308 (near miss, boot 0x00288308, 220 bytes, 28 places).
 *
 * The activate arm of the class-record updaters in game/002880E0.c.  Retail:
 *   - if the byte at 0x1A7AF8[a0] is already set, return (void function);
 *   - set 0x1A7B30[a0] and 0x1A7AF8[a0] to 1, in that order;
 *   - when the record's halfword at +0x88 is non-zero and the count word at
 *     0x139688[a0] is zero, copy the halfword at +0x92 into the count (note the
 *     direction: the non-zero halfword gates the store, it is not tested as a
 *     cleared flag);
 *   - call func_002883E8 and then func_00288208 with the same id;
 *   - for id 0x10 only: when func_00288D58() is non-zero call
 *     func_00287FF8(0x10, 2) and then clear 0x1398A8, which is inside that
 *     inner if.
 *
 * Measured: -O2 -G0 -ffunction-sections, 220 bytes, exact size, 0 of 28
 * places.  Instruction at +0x8 is the first difference: retail keeps the
 * `lui`/`addiu` pair of D_001A7AF8 together before the two `sd` prologue
 * stores, this cc1 puts `sd $s0` between them, and the same hoisting
 * difference moves the two address additions (`$s0 + D_00139568` and
 * `$s0 + 0x1A7B30`) four instructions earlier in retail.  Every instruction
 * and operand otherwise agrees (including the shared `$v0 = 1` for both
 * byte stores).  `-fno-schedule-insns` reproduced the same difference.
 * Reopen only with evidence for the original statement order, e.g. a sibling
 * whose prologue has the same hoist.
