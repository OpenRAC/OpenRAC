/* func_L10_00425888: clamps the four 32-bit values at D_L10_001B1390 to 127 and copies their
   low bytes into the block at D_L10_001395B8 (+0x66..+0x69).
   Built -G8.  Retail reads the first word through $gp everywhere (sda) and the other three
   as absolute macro loads at the first word + 4/8/12.  The offset form is also why those
   three loads never fill a delay slot: this cc1 gives a symbol+offset memory operand length 2
   (simple_memory_operand accepts only a bare small-data symbol), so each clamp's branch slot
   takes the 127 from the fall-through, as in retail, and the last branch steals the bare
   $gp load of the first word from its target.  Two names for the one block: the sda scalar
   and the absolute macro form of the same address (D_L10_001B1390_4). */
